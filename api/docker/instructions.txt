create a directory where you will fork the project from github: namely,
you want the to have the dockerfile and docker-compose files

    provided you have docker installed, run the command:
     a. "docker-compose up"
     b. or to run it the background "docker-compose up -d". Otherwise use two terminals to work
     go to browser and type "127.0.0.1:8000" 
     It should show django homepage

Docker commands:
if you run it the background you can type 
"docker ps" and it will show you the containers running. From here we can get the id of the container to stop the container from running.
"docker-compose down" to stop docker running
"docker exec 04a5a80307ee pkill -f "python manage.py runserver" : the "04a5a80307ee" is the id of the container - replace it
